# User Tests

## Can you describe what you're seeing?

- I'm in a room with stone walls, there's a gate in front of me and behind me. There's some balls floating in the air.

## How big do you feel in this scene?

- My normal size. I might be floating a little bit though.


## How would you describe the mood?

- Haunting, a little dark. Is this supposed to be a dungeon?


## What actions would you like to be able to take?

- Maybe check out those barrels. Open and close the gate. Maybe do some stuff with the orbs. This feels incomplete.

# Findings

The orbs are interesting but don't make sense and there's not enough to do in the scene so its important to add some interactive elements.

# User Test: Menu

## What's the interaction experience like?

Buttons are easy to use. I like the circle size changes. Fonts are pretty gross - I assume you're going to change them. The menu is a little dark but it kind of matches the mood.
